* Introduction
** Why this tool exists
When I use ssh command to login remote server in terminal, it always can't store user and password for me. And I have to input password every time.
So that, I want to a tool to help me store my passwords.

** Why use perl
I don't know, maybe I don't hate perl language and I want to learn more a language. At least, I think it is better then python.
